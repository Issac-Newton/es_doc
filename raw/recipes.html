</div></div></div>
<p>When building a search application, stemming is often a must as it is desirable
for a query on <code class="literal">skiing</code> to match documents that contain <code class="literal">ski</code> or <code class="literal">skis</code>. But
what if a user wants to search for <code class="literal">skiing</code> specifically? The typical way to do
this would be to use a <a class="xref" href="mapping-params.html#multi-fields" title="fields">multi-field</a> in order to have the same
content indexed in two different ways:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">PUT index
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "analyzer": {
        "english_exact": {
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": [
            "lowercase"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "body": {
        "type": "text",
        "analyzer": "english",
        "fields": {
          "exact": {
            "type": "text",
            "analyzer": "english_exact"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT index/_doc/1
{
  "body": "Ski resort"
}

PUT index/_doc/2
{
  "body": "A pair of skis"
}

POST index/_refresh</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1517.console"></div>
<p>With such a setup, searching for <code class="literal">ski</code> on <code class="literal">body</code> would return both documents:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "simple_query_string": {
      "fields": [ "body" ],
      "query": "ski"
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1518.console"></div>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console-result">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console-result">{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total" : {
        "value": 2,
        "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.18232156,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "index",
        "_type": "_doc",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 0.18232156,
        "_source": {
          "body": "Ski resort"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "index",
        "_type": "_doc",
        "_id": "2",
        "_score": 0.18232156,
        "_source": {
          "body": "A pair of skis"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, searching for <code class="literal">ski</code> on <code class="literal">body.exact</code> would only return
document <code class="literal">1</code> since the analysis chain of <code class="literal">body.exact</code> does not perform
stemming.</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "simple_query_string": {
      "fields": [ "body.exact" ],
      "query": "ski"
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1519.console"></div>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console-result">

    "skipped" : 0,

  },
  "hits": {
    "total" : {
        "value": 1,
        "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.8025915,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "index",

        }
      }
    ]
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>This is not something that is easy to expose to end users, as we would need to
have a way to figure out whether they are looking for an exact match or not and
redirect to the appropriate field accordingly. Also what to do if only parts of
the query need to be matched exactly while other parts should still take
stemming into account?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <code class="literal">query_string</code> and <code class="literal">simple_query_string</code> queries have a feature
that solves this exact problem: <code class="literal">quote_field_suffix</code>. This tells Elasticsearch
that the words that appear in between quotes are to be redirected to a different
field, see below:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "simple_query_string": {
      "fields": [ "body" ],
      "quote_field_suffix": ".exact",
      "query": "\"ski\""
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1520.console"></div>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console-result">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console-result">{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total" : {
        "value": 1,
        "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.8025915,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "index",
        "_type": "_doc",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 0.8025915,
        "_source": {
          "body": "Ski resort"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>In the above case, since <code class="literal">ski</code> was in-between quotes, it was searched on the
<code class="literal">body.exact</code> field due to the <code class="literal">quote_field_suffix</code> parameter, so only document
<code class="literal">1</code> matched. This allows users to mix exact search with stemmed search as they
like.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If the choice of field passed in <code class="literal">quote_field_suffix</code> does not exist
the search will fall back to using the default field for the query string.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>The fact that Elasticsearch operates with shards and replicas adds challenges
when it comes to having good scoring.</p>
<h4><a id="_scores_are_not_reproducible"></a>Scores are not reproducible<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.10/docs/reference/how-to/recipes/scoring.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Say the same user runs the same request twice in a row and documents do not come
back in the same order both times, this is a pretty bad experience isn&#8217;t it?
Unfortunately this is something that can happen if you have replicas
(<code class="literal">index.number_of_replicas</code> is greater than 0). The reason is that Elasticsearch
selects the shards that the query should go to in a round-robin fashion, so it
is quite likely if you run the same query twice in a row that it will go to
different copies of the same shard.</p>
<p>Now why is it a problem? Index statistics are an important part of the score.
And these index statistics may be different across copies of the same shard
due to deleted documents. As you may know when documents are deleted or updated,
the old document is not immediately removed from the index, it is just marked
as deleted and it will only be removed from disk on the next time that the
segment this old document belongs to is merged. However for practical reasons,
those deleted documents are taken into account for index statistics. So imagine
that the primary shard just finished a large merge that removed lots of deleted
documents, then it might have index statistics that are sufficiently different
from the replica (which still have plenty of deleted documents) so that scores
are different too.</p>
<p>The recommended way to work around this issue is to use a string that identifies
the user that is logged in (a user id or session id for instance) as a
<a class="xref" href="search.html#search-preference">preference</a>. This ensures that all queries of a
given user are always going to hit the same shards, so scores remain more
consistent across queries.</p>
<p>This work around has another benefit: when two documents have the same score,
they will be sorted by their internal Lucene doc id (which is unrelated to the
<code class="literal">_id</code>) by default. However these doc ids could be different across copies of
the same shard. So by always hitting the same shard, we would get more
consistent ordering of documents that have the same scores.</p>
<h4><a id="_relevancy_looks_wrong"></a>Relevancy looks wrong<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.10/docs/reference/how-to/recipes/scoring.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>If you notice that two documents with the same content get different scores or
that an exact match is not ranked first, then the issue might be related to
sharding. By default, Elasticsearch makes each shard responsible for producing
its own scores. However since index statistics are an important contributor to
the scores, this only works well if shards have similar index statistics. The
assumption is that since documents are routed evenly to shards by default, then
index statistics should be very similar and scoring would work as expected.
However in the event that you either:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
use routing at index time,
</li>
<li class="listitem">
query multiple <em>indices</em>,
</li>
<li class="listitem">
or have too little data in your index
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>then there are good chances that all shards that are involved in the search
request do not have similar index statistics and relevancy could be bad.</p>
<p>If you have a small dataset, the easiest way to work around this issue is to
index everything into an index that has a single shard
(<code class="literal">index.number_of_shards: 1</code>), which is the default. Then index statistics
will be the same for all documents and scores will be consistent.</p>
<p>Otherwise the recommended way to work around this issue is to use the
<a class="xref" href="search.html#dfs-query-then-fetch"><code class="literal">dfs_query_then_fetch</code></a> search type. This will make
Elasticsearch perform an initial round trip to all involved shards, asking
them for their index statistics relatively to the query, then the coordinating
node will merge those statistics and send the merged statistics alongside the
request when asking shards to perform the <code class="literal">query</code> phase, so that shards can
use these global statistics rather than their own statistics in order to do the
scoring.</p>
<p>In most cases, this additional round trip should be very cheap. However in the
event that your query contains a very large number of fields/terms or fuzzy
queries, beware that gathering statistics alone might not be cheap since all
terms have to be looked up in the terms dictionaries in order to look up
statistics.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>Many domains have static signals that are known to be correlated with relevance.
For instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank" class="ulink" target="_top">PageRank</a> and url length are
two commonly used features for web search in order to tune the score of web
pages independently of the query.</p>
<p>There are two main queries that allow combining static score contributions with
textual relevance, eg. as computed with BM25:
 - <a class="xref" href="specialized-queries.html#query-dsl-script-score-query" title="Script score query"><code class="literal">script_score</code> query</a>
 - <a class="xref" href="specialized-queries.html#query-dsl-rank-feature-query" title="Rank feature query"><code class="literal">rank_feature</code> query</a></p>
<p>For instance imagine that you have a <code class="literal">pagerank</code> field that you wish to
combine with the BM25 score so that the final score is equal to
<code class="literal">score = bm25_score + pagerank / (10 + pagerank)</code>.</p>
<p>With the <a class="xref" href="specialized-queries.html#query-dsl-script-score-query" title="Script score query"><code class="literal">script_score</code> query</a> the query would
look like this:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "script_score": {
      "query": {
        "match": { "body": "elasticsearch" }
      },
      "script": {
        "source": "_score * saturation(doc['pagerank'].value, 10)" <a id="CO590-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1521.console"></div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">

<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO590-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>

<td align="left" valign="top">
<p><code class="literal">pagerank</code> must be mapped as a <a class="xref" href="mapping-types.html#number" title="Numeric field types">Numeric</a></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>while with the <a class="xref" href="specialized-queries.html#query-dsl-rank-feature-query" title="Rank feature query"><code class="literal">rank_feature</code> query</a> it would
look like below:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": {
        "match": { "body": "elasticsearch" }
      },
      "should": {
        "rank_feature": {
          "field": "pagerank", <a id="CO591-1"></a><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i>
          "saturation": {
            "pivot": 10
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/1522.console"></div>
<div class="calloutlist">
<table border="0" summary="Callout list">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="5%">
<p><a href="#CO591-1"><i class="conum" data-value="1"></i></a></p>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p><code class="literal">pagerank</code> must be mapped as a <a class="xref" href="mapping-types.html#rank-feature" title="Rank feature field type"><code class="literal">rank_feature</code></a> field</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>While both options would return similar scores, there are trade-offs:
<a class="xref" href="specialized-queries.html#query-dsl-script-score-query" title="Script score query">script_score</a> provides a lot of flexibility,
enabling you to combine the text relevance score with static signals as you
prefer. On the other hand, the <a class="xref" href="mapping-types.html#rank-feature" title="Rank feature field type"><code class="literal">rank_feature</code> query</a> only
exposes a couple ways to incorporate static signails into the score. However,
it relies on the <a class="xref" href="mapping-types.html#rank-feature" title="Rank feature field type"><code class="literal">rank_feature</code></a> and
<a class="xref" href="mapping-types.html#rank-features" title="Rank features field type"><code class="literal">rank_features</code></a> fields, which index values in a special way
that allows the <a class="xref" href="specialized-queries.html#query-dsl-rank-feature-query" title="Rank feature query"><code class="literal">rank_feature</code> query</a> to skip
over non-competitive documents and get the top matches of a query faster.</p>
