<p>The discovery and cluster formation processes are responsible for discovering
nodes, electing a master, forming a cluster, and publishing the cluster state
each time it changes. All communication between nodes is done using the
<a class="xref" href="settings.html#modules-transport" title="Transport">transport</a> layer.</p>

It is recommended to have a small and fixed number of master-eligible nodes
in a cluster, and to scale the cluster up and down by adding and removing
master-ineligible nodes only. However there are situations in which it may
be desirable to add or remove some master-eligible nodes to or from a
cluster. This section describes the process for adding or removing
master-eligible nodes, including the extra steps that need to be performed
when removing more than half of the master-eligible nodes at the same time.

<p>Discovery is the process by which the cluster formation module finds other
nodes with which to form a cluster. This process runs when you start an
Elasticsearch node or when a node believes the master node failed and continues
until the master node is found or a new master node is elected.</p>
<p>This process starts with a list of <em>seed</em> addresses from one or more
<a class="xref" href="modules-discovery.html#built-in-hosts-providers" title="Seed hosts providers">seed hosts providers</a>, together with the addresses
of any master-eligible nodes that were in the last-known cluster. The process
operates in two phases: First, each node probes the seed addresses by
connecting to each address and attempting to identify the node to which it is
connected and to verify that it is master-eligible. Secondly, if successful, it
shares with the remote node a list of all of its known master-eligible peers
and the remote node responds with <em>its</em> peers in turn. The node then probes all
the new nodes that it just discovered, requests their peers, and so on.</p>
<p>If the node is not master-eligible then it continues this discovery process
until it has discovered an elected master node. If no elected master is
discovered then the node will retry after <code class="literal">discovery.find_peers_interval</code> which
defaults to <code class="literal">1s</code>.</p>
<p>If the node is master-eligible then it continues this discovery process until
it has either discovered an elected master node or else it has discovered
enough masterless master-eligible nodes to complete an election. If neither of
these occur quickly enough then the node will retry after
<code class="literal">discovery.find_peers_interval</code> which defaults to <code class="literal">1s</code>.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>By default the cluster formation module offers two seed hosts providers to
configure the list of seed nodes: a <em>settings</em>-based and a <em>file</em>-based seed
hosts provider.  It can be extended to support cloud environments and other
forms of seed hosts providers via <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/7.10/discovery.html" class="ulink" target="_top">discovery plugins</a>.
Seed hosts providers are configured using the <code class="literal">discovery.seed_providers</code>
setting, which defaults to the <em>settings</em>-based hosts provider. This setting
accepts a list of different providers, allowing you to make use of multiple
ways to find the seed hosts for your cluster.</p>
<p>Each seed hosts provider yields the IP addresses or hostnames of the seed
nodes. If it returns any hostnames then these are resolved to IP addresses
using a DNS lookup. If a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses then Elasticsearch
tries to find a seed node at all of these addresses. If the hosts provider does
not explicitly give the TCP port of the node by then, it will implicitly use the
first port in the port range given by <code class="literal">transport.profiles.default.port</code>, or by
<code class="literal">transport.port</code> if <code class="literal">transport.profiles.default.port</code> is not set. The number of
concurrent lookups is controlled by
<code class="literal">discovery.seed_resolver.max_concurrent_resolvers</code> which defaults to <code class="literal">10</code>, and
the timeout for each lookup is controlled by <code class="literal">discovery.seed_resolver.timeout</code>
which defaults to <code class="literal">5s</code>. Note that DNS lookups are subject to
<a class="xref" href="system-config.html#networkaddress-cache-ttl" title="DNS cache settings">JVM DNS caching</a>.</p>

<p>The settings-based seed hosts provider uses a node setting to configure a
static list of the addresses of the seed nodes. These addresses can be given as
hostnames or IP addresses; hosts specified as hostnames are resolved to IP
addresses during each round of discovery.</p>
<p>The list of hosts is set using the <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#unicast.hosts" title="discovery.seed_hosts"><code class="literal">discovery.seed_hosts</code></a>
static setting. For example:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">discovery.seed_hosts:

<p>The file-based seed hosts provider configures a list of hosts via an external
file.  Elasticsearch reloads this file when it changes, so that the list of seed nodes
can change dynamically without needing to restart each node. For example, this
gives a convenient mechanism for an Elasticsearch instance that is run in a Docker
container to be dynamically supplied with a list of IP addresses to connect to
when those IP addresses may not be known at node startup.</p>
<p>To enable file-based discovery, configure the <code class="literal">file</code> hosts provider as follows
in the <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> file:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-yml">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yml">discovery.seed_providers: file</pre>
</div>
<p>Then create a file at <code class="literal">$ES_PATH_CONF/unicast_hosts.txt</code> in the format described
below. Any time a change is made to the <code class="literal">unicast_hosts.txt</code> file the new
changes will be picked up by Elasticsearch and the new hosts list will be used.</p>
<p>Note that the file-based discovery plugin augments the unicast hosts list in
<code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>: if there are valid seed addresses in
<code class="literal">discovery.seed_hosts</code> then Elasticsearch uses those addresses in addition to those
supplied in <code class="literal">unicast_hosts.txt</code>.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">unicast_hosts.txt</code> file contains one node entry per line. Each node entry
consists of the host (host name or IP address) and an optional transport port
number. If the port number is specified, is must come immediately after the
host (on the same line) separated by a <code class="literal">:</code>.  If the port number is not
specified, Elasticsearch will implicitly use the first port in the port range given by
<code class="literal">transport.profiles.default.port</code>, or by <code class="literal">transport.port</code> if
<code class="literal">transport.profiles.default.port</code> is not set.</p>
<p>For example, this is an example of <code class="literal">unicast_hosts.txt</code> for a cluster with four
nodes that participate in discovery, some of which are not running on the
default port:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-txt">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-txt">10.10.10.5
10.10.10.6:9305
10.10.10.5:10005

[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]:9301</pre>
</div>
<p>Host names are allowed instead of IP addresses and are resolved by DNS as
described above. IPv6 addresses must be given in brackets with the port, if
needed, coming after the brackets.</p>
<p>You can also add comments to this file. All comments must appear on their lines
starting with <code class="literal">#</code> (i.e. comments cannot start in the middle of a line).</p>

<p>Electing a master node and changing the cluster state are the two fundamental
tasks that master-eligible nodes must work together to perform. It is important
that these activities work robustly even if some nodes have failed.
Elasticsearch achieves this robustness by considering each action to have
succeeded on receipt of responses from a <em>quorum</em>, which is a subset of the
master-eligible nodes in the cluster. The advantage of requiring only a subset
of the nodes to respond is that it means some of the nodes can fail without
preventing the cluster from making progress. The quorums are carefully chosen so
the cluster does not have a "split brain" scenario where it&#8217;s partitioned into
two pieces such that each piece may make decisions that are inconsistent with
those of the other piece.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch allows you to add and remove master-eligible nodes to a running
cluster. In many cases you can do this simply by starting or stopping the nodes
as required. See <a class="xref" href="getting-started-modify-data.html#modules-discovery-adding-removing-nodes" title="Adding and removing nodes">Adding and removing nodes</a>.</p>
<p>As nodes are added or removed Elasticsearch maintains an optimal level of fault
tolerance by updating the cluster&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery.html#modules-discovery-voting" title="Voting configurations">voting
configuration</a>, which is the set of master-eligible nodes whose responses are
counted when making decisions such as electing a new master or committing a new
cluster state. A decision is made only after more than half of the nodes in the
voting configuration have responded.  Usually the voting configuration is the
same as the set of all the master-eligible nodes that are currently in the
cluster. However, there are some situations in which they may be different.</p>
<p>To be sure that the cluster remains available you <span class="strong strong"><strong>must not stop half or more
of the nodes in the voting configuration at the same time</strong></span>. As long as more
than half of the voting nodes are available the cluster can still work normally.
This means that if there are three or four master-eligible nodes, the cluster
can tolerate one of them being unavailable. If there are two or fewer
master-eligible nodes, they must all remain available.</p>
<p>After a node has joined or left the cluster the elected master must issue a
cluster-state update that adjusts the voting configuration to match, and this
can take a short time to complete. It is important to wait for this adjustment
to complete before removing more nodes from the cluster.</p>
<h4><a id="_master_elections"></a>Master elections<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.10/docs/reference/modules/discovery/quorums.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>Elasticsearch uses an election process to agree on an elected master node, both
at startup and if the existing elected master fails. Any master-eligible node
can start an election, and normally the first election that takes place will
succeed. Elections only usually fail when two nodes both happen to start their
elections at about the same time, so elections are scheduled randomly on each
node to reduce the probability of this happening. Nodes will retry elections
until a master is elected, backing off on failure, so that eventually an
election will succeed (with arbitrarily high probability). The scheduling of
master elections are controlled by the <a class="xref" href="settings.html#master-election-settings">master
election settings</a>.</p>

<p>Many cluster maintenance tasks involve temporarily shutting down one or more
nodes and then starting them back up again. By default Elasticsearch can remain
available if one of its master-eligible nodes is taken offline, such as during a
<a class="xref" href="rolling-upgrades.html" title="Rolling upgrades">rolling restart</a>. Furthermore, if multiple nodes are stopped
and then started again then it will automatically recover, such as during a
<a class="xref" href="restart-upgrade.html" title="Full cluster restart upgrade">full cluster restart</a>. There is no need to take any further
action with the APIs described here in these cases, because the set of master
nodes is not changing permanently.</p>

<p>Each Elasticsearch cluster has a <em>voting configuration</em>, which is the set of
<a class="xref" href="settings.html#master-node" title="Master-eligible node">master-eligible nodes</a> whose responses are counted when making
decisions such as electing a new master or committing a new cluster state.
Decisions are made only after a majority (more than half) of the nodes in the
voting configuration respond.</p>
<p>Usually the voting configuration is the same as the set of all the
master-eligible nodes that are currently in the cluster. However, there are some
situations in which they may be different.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>To ensure the cluster remains available, you <span class="strong strong"><strong>must not stop half or
more of the nodes in the voting configuration at the same time</strong></span>. As long as more
than half of the voting nodes are available, the cluster can work normally. For
example, if there are three or four master-eligible nodes, the cluster
can tolerate one unavailable node. If there are two or fewer master-eligible
nodes, they must all remain available.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After a node joins or leaves the cluster, Elasticsearch reacts by automatically making
corresponding changes to the voting configuration in order to ensure that the
cluster is as resilient as possible. It is important to wait for this adjustment
to complete before you remove more nodes from the cluster. For more information,
see <a class="xref" href="getting-started-modify-data.html#modules-discovery-adding-removing-nodes" title="Adding and removing nodes">Adding and removing nodes</a>.</p>
<p>The current voting configuration is stored in the cluster state so you can
inspect its current contents as follows:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-console">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-console">GET /_cluster/state?filter_path=metadata.cluster_coordination.last_committed_config</pre>
</div>
<div class="console_widget" data-snippet="snippets/42.console"></div>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>The current voting configuration is not necessarily the same as the set of
all available master-eligible nodes in the cluster. Altering the voting
configuration involves taking a vote, so it takes some time to adjust the
configuration as nodes join or leave the cluster. Also, there are situations
where the most resilient configuration includes unavailable nodes or does not
include some available nodes. In these situations, the voting configuration
differs from the set of available master-eligible nodes in the cluster.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Larger voting configurations are usually more resilient, so Elasticsearch
normally prefers to add master-eligible nodes to the voting configuration after
they join the cluster. Similarly, if a node in the voting configuration
leaves the cluster and there is another master-eligible node in the cluster that
is not in the voting configuration then it is preferable to swap these two nodes
over. The size of the voting configuration is thus unchanged but its
resilience increases.</p>
<p>It is not so straightforward to automatically remove nodes from the voting
configuration after they have left the cluster. Different strategies have
different benefits and drawbacks, so the right choice depends on how the cluster
will be used. You can control whether the voting configuration automatically
shrinks by using the
<a class="xref" href="settings.html#modules-discovery-settings" title="Discovery and cluster formation settings"><code class="literal">cluster.auto_shrink_voting_configuration</code> setting</a>.</p>
<div class="note admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>If <code class="literal">cluster.auto_shrink_voting_configuration</code> is set to <code class="literal">true</code> (which is
the default and recommended value) and there are at least three master-eligible
nodes in the cluster, Elasticsearch remains capable of processing cluster state
updates as long as all but one of its master-eligible nodes are healthy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are situations in which Elasticsearch might tolerate the loss of multiple
nodes, but this is not guaranteed under all sequences of failures. If the
<code class="literal">cluster.auto_shrink_voting_configuration</code> setting is <code class="literal">false</code>, you must remove
departed nodes from the voting configuration manually. Use the
<a class="xref" href="cluster.html#voting-config-exclusions" title="Voting configuration exclusions API">voting exclusions API</a> to achieve the desired level
of resilience.</p>
<p>No matter how it is configured, Elasticsearch will not suffer from a
"split-brain" inconsistency. The <code class="literal">cluster.auto_shrink_voting_configuration</code>
setting affects only its availability in the event of the failure of some of its
nodes and the administrative tasks that must be performed as nodes join and
leave the cluster.</p>
<h4><a id="_even_numbers_of_master_eligible_nodes"></a>Even numbers of master-eligible nodes<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.10/docs/reference/modules/discovery/voting.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>There should normally be an odd number of master-eligible nodes in a cluster.
If there is an even number, Elasticsearch leaves one of them out of the voting
configuration to ensure that it has an odd size. This omission does not decrease
the failure-tolerance of the cluster. In fact, improves it slightly: if the
cluster suffers from a network partition that divides it into two equally-sized
halves then one of the halves will contain a majority of the voting
configuration and will be able to keep operating. If all of the votes from
master-eligible nodes were counted, neither side would contain a strict majority
of the nodes and so the cluster would not be able to make any progress.</p>
<p>For instance if there are four master-eligible nodes in the cluster and the
voting configuration contained all of them, any quorum-based decision would
require votes from at least three of them. This situation means that the cluster
can tolerate the loss of only a single master-eligible node. If this cluster
were split into two equal halves, neither half would contain three
master-eligible nodes and the cluster would not be able to make any progress.
If the voting configuration contains only three of the four master-eligible
nodes, however, the cluster is still only fully tolerant to the loss of one
node, but quorum-based decisions require votes from two of the three voting
nodes. In the event of an even split, one half will contain two of the three
voting nodes so that half will remain available.</p>
<h4><a id="_setting_the_initial_voting_configuration"></a>Setting the initial voting configuration<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.10/docs/reference/modules/discovery/voting.asciidoc">edit</a></h4>
<p>When a brand-new cluster starts up for the first time, it must elect its first
master node. To do this election, it needs to know the set of master-eligible
nodes whose votes should count. This initial voting configuration is known as
the <em>bootstrap configuration</em> and is set in the
<a class="xref" href="modules-discovery.html#modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster" title="Bootstrapping a cluster">cluster bootstrapping process</a>.</p>
<p>It is important that the bootstrap configuration identifies exactly which nodes
should vote in the first election. It is not sufficient to configure each node
with an expectation of how many nodes there should be in the cluster. It is also
important to note that the bootstrap configuration must come from outside the
cluster: there is no safe way for the cluster to determine the bootstrap
configuration correctly on its own.</p>
<p>If the bootstrap configuration is not set correctly, when you start a brand-new
cluster there is a risk that you will accidentally form two separate clusters
instead of one. This situation can lead to data loss: you might start using both
clusters before you notice that anything has gone wrong and it is impossible to
merge them together later.</p>

<p>To illustrate the problem with configuring each node to expect a certain
cluster size, imagine starting up a three-node cluster in which each node knows
that it is going to be part of a three-node cluster. A majority of three nodes
is two, so normally the first two nodes to discover each other form a cluster
and the third node joins them a short time later. However, imagine that four
nodes were erroneously started instead of three. In this case, there are enough
nodes to form two separate clusters. Of course if each node is started manually
then it&#8217;s unlikely that too many nodes are started. If you&#8217;re using an automated
orchestrator, however, it&#8217;s certainly possible to get into this situation--
particularly if the orchestrator is not resilient to failures such as network
partitions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The initial quorum is only required the very first time a whole cluster starts
up. New nodes joining an established cluster can safely obtain all the
information they need from the elected master. Nodes that have previously been
part of a cluster will have stored to disk all the information that is required
when they restart.</p>

<p>Starting an Elasticsearch cluster for the very first time requires the initial
set of <a class="xref" href="settings.html#master-node" title="Master-eligible node">master-eligible nodes</a> to be explicitly defined on one or
more of the master-eligible nodes in the cluster. This is known as <em>cluster
bootstrapping</em>. This is only required the first time a cluster starts up: nodes
that have already joined a cluster store this information in their data folder
for use in a <a class="xref" href="restart-upgrade.html" title="Full cluster restart upgrade">full cluster restart</a>, and freshly-started nodes
that are joining a running cluster obtain this information from the cluster&#8217;s
elected master.</p>
<p>The initial set of master-eligible nodes is defined in the
<a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#initial_master_nodes" title="cluster.initial_master_nodes"><code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> setting</a>. This should be
set to a list containing one of the following items for each master-eligible
node:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#node-name" title="Node name setting">node name</a> of the node.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The node&#8217;s hostname if <code class="literal">node.name</code> is not set, because <code class="literal">node.name</code> defaults
to the node&#8217;s hostname. You must use either the fully-qualified hostname or
the bare hostname <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery.html#modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster-fqdns">depending on
your system configuration</a>.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The IP address of the node&#8217;s <a class="xref" href="settings.html#modules-transport" title="Transport">publish address</a>, if it is
not possible to use the <code class="literal">node.name</code> of the node. This is normally the IP
address to which <a class="xref" href="settings.html#common-network-settings" title="Commonly used network settings"><code class="literal">network.host</code></a> resolves but
<a class="xref" href="settings.html#advanced-network-settings" title="Advanced network settings">this can be overridden</a>.

<li class="listitem">
The IP address and port of the node&#8217;s publish address, in the form <code class="literal">IP:PORT</code>,

multiple nodes sharing a single IP address.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When you start a master-eligible node, you can provide this setting on the
command line or in the <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> file. After the cluster has formed,
this setting is no longer required. It should not be set for master-ineligible
nodes, master-eligible nodes joining an existing cluster, or cluster restarts.</p>
<p>It is technically sufficient to set <code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> on a single
master-eligible node in the cluster, and only to mention that single node in the
setting&#8217;s value, but this provides no fault tolerance before the cluster has
fully formed. It is therefore better to bootstrap using at least three
master-eligible nodes, each with a <code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> setting
containing all three nodes.</p>
<div class="warning admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>You must set <code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> to the same list of nodes
on each node on which it is set in order to be sure that only a single cluster

</div>
<p>For a cluster with 3 master-eligible nodes (with <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#node-name" title="Node name setting">node names</a>

<p>Like all node settings, it is also possible to specify the initial set of master
nodes on the command-line that is used to start Elasticsearch:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-bash">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-bash">$ bin/elasticsearch -Ecluster.initial_master_nodes=master-a,master-b,master-c</pre>

<div class="admon_content">
<p><a id="modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster-fqdns"></a> The node names used in the
<code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> list must exactly match the <code class="literal">node.name</code>

hostname which may or may not be fully-qualified depending on your system
configuration. If each node name is a fully-qualified domain name such as
<code class="literal">master-a.example.com</code> then you must use fully-qualified domain names in the
<code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> list too; conversely if your node names are bare
hostnames (without the <code class="literal">.example.com</code> suffix) then you must use bare hostnames
in the <code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> list. If you use a mix of fully-qualifed

you will see log messages like the following.</p>

<p>The <a class="xref" href="important-settings.html#cluster-name" title="Cluster name setting"><code class="literal">cluster.name</code></a> setting enables you to create multiple
clusters which are separated from each other. Nodes verify that they agree on
their cluster name when they first connect to each other, and Elasticsearch
will only form a cluster from nodes that all have the same cluster name. The
default value for the cluster name is <code class="literal">elasticsearch</code>, but it is recommended to
change this to reflect the logical name of the cluster.</p>

<p>If the cluster is running with a completely default configuration then it will
automatically bootstrap a cluster based on the nodes that could be discovered to
be running on the same host within a short time after startup. This means that
by default it is possible to start up several nodes on a single machine and have
them automatically form a cluster which is very useful for development
environments and experimentation.  However, since nodes may not always
successfully discover each other quickly enough this automatic bootstrapping
cannot be relied upon and cannot be used in production deployments.</p>
<p>If any of the following settings are configured then auto-bootstrapping will not
take place, and you must configure <code class="literal">cluster.initial_master_nodes</code> as described
in the <a class="xref" href="modules-discovery.html#modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster" title="Bootstrapping a cluster">section on cluster bootstrapping</a>:</p>

<p><a id="modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster-joining"></a> If you start an Elasticsearch node
without configuring these settings then it will start up in development mode and
auto-bootstrap itself into a new cluster. If you start some Elasticsearch nodes on
different hosts then by default they will not discover each other and will form
a different cluster on each host. Elasticsearch will not merge separate clusters together
after they have formed, even if you subsequently try and configure all the nodes
into a single cluster. This is because there is no way to merge these separate
clusters together without a risk of data loss. You can tell that you have formed
separate clusters by checking the cluster UUID reported by <code class="literal">GET /</code> on each node.

<p>The master node is the only node in a cluster that can make changes to the
cluster state. The master node processes one batch of cluster state updates at
a time, computing the required changes and publishing the updated cluster state
to all the other nodes in the cluster. Each publication starts with the master
broadcasting the updated cluster state to all nodes in the cluster.  Each node
responds with an acknowledgement but does not yet apply the newly-received
state. Once the master has collected acknowledgements from enough
master-eligible nodes, the new cluster state is said to be <em>committed</em> and the
master broadcasts another message instructing nodes to apply the now-committed
state. Each node receives this message, applies the updated state, and then
sends a second acknowledgement back to the master.</p>
<p>The master allows a limited amount of time for each cluster state update to be
completely published to all nodes. It is defined by the
<code class="literal">cluster.publish.timeout</code> setting, which defaults to <code class="literal">30s</code>, measured from the
time the publication started. If this time is reached before the new cluster
state is committed then the cluster state change is rejected and the master
considers itself to have failed. It stands down and starts trying to elect a
new master.</p>
<p>If the new cluster state is committed before <code class="literal">cluster.publish.timeout</code> has
elapsed, the master node considers the change to have succeeded. It waits until
the timeout has elapsed or until it has received acknowledgements that each
node in the cluster has applied the updated state, and then starts processing
and publishing the next cluster state update. If some acknowledgements have not
been received (i.e. some nodes have not yet confirmed that they have applied
the current update), these nodes are said to be <em>lagging</em> since their cluster
states have fallen behind the master&#8217;s latest state. The master waits for the
lagging nodes to catch up for a further time, <code class="literal">cluster.follower_lag.timeout</code>,
which defaults to <code class="literal">90s</code>. If a node has still not successfully applied the
cluster state update within this time then it is considered to have failed and
is removed from the cluster.</p>
<p>Cluster state updates are typically published as diffs to the previous cluster
state, which reduces the time and network bandwidth needed to publish a cluster
state update. For example, when updating the mappings for only a subset of the
indices in the cluster state, only the updates for those indices need to be
published to the nodes in the cluster, as long as those nodes have the previous
cluster state. If a node is missing the previous cluster state, for example
when rejoining a cluster, the master will publish the full cluster state to
that node so that it can receive future updates as diffs.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch is a peer to peer based system, in which nodes communicate with one
another directly. The high-throughput APIs (index, delete, search) do not
normally interact with the master node. The responsibility of the master node
is to maintain the global cluster state and reassign shards when nodes join or
leave the cluster. Each time the cluster state is changed, the new state is
published to all nodes in the cluster as described above.</p>

<p>The elected master periodically checks each of the nodes in the cluster to
ensure that they are still connected and healthy. Each node in the cluster also
periodically checks the health of the elected master. These checks are known
respectively as <em>follower checks</em> and <em>leader checks</em>.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch allows these checks to occasionally fail or timeout without
taking any action. It considers a node to be faulty only after a number of
consecutive checks have failed. You can control fault detection behavior with
<a class="xref" href="settings.html#modules-discovery-settings" title="Discovery and cluster formation settings"><code class="literal">cluster.fault_detection.*</code> settings</a>.</p>
<p>If the elected master detects that a node has disconnected, however, this
situation is treated as an immediate failure. The master bypasses the timeout
and retry setting values and attempts to remove the node from the cluster.
Similarly, if a node detects that the elected master has disconnected, this
situation is treated as an immediate failure. The node bypasses the timeout and
retry settings and restarts its discovery phase to try and find or elect a new
master.</p>
<p><a id="cluster-fault-detection-filesystem-health"></a>Additionally, each node periodically verifies that its data path is healthy by
writing a small file to disk and then deleting it again. If a node discovers
its data path is unhealthy then it is removed from the cluster until the data
path recovers. You can control this behavior with the
